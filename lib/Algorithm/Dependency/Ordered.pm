=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered - Implements an ordered dependency heirachy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered implements the most common variety of
L<Algorithm::Dependency>, the one in which the dependencies of an item must
be acted upon before the item itself can be acted upon.

In use and semantics, this should be used in exactly the same way as for the
main parent class. Please note that the output of the C<depends> method is
NOT changed, as the order of the depends is not assumed to be important.
Only the output of the C<schedule> method is modified to ensure the correct
order.

For API details, see L<Algorithm::Dependency>.
